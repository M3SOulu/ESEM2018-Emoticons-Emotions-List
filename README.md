# ESEM2018-Emoticons-Emotions-List

This repository contains the list of emoticons and emotions used for
the ESEM paper "On the Use of Emoticons in Open Source Software
Development".

The CSV file "emoticons_emotions.csv" contains two columns, one
representing the emoticons searched, and the other containing the
emotions associated to them when it was found in the Apache and
Mozilla issue trackers.

The second file "emoticons_regex.csv" contains a single column
containing the different regular expressions that were used to search
for emoticons from issue tracker comments.
